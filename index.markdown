title: Navigating San Francisco Airport Through Data Visualization
---

Located in the center of Northern California, San Francisco Airport is a busy hub that links passengers from all over the world. However, some of the historical occurrences and seasonal cycles that have influenced its dynamics and operations may be found under its current appearance.

We're doing more than simply examining statistics and graphs in this investigation; we're also making connections between data points and historical events, seasonal variations, and other contextual elements.

# [Trends Over Time](/posts/temporalEvolution.md)

We'll delve into how passenger traffic fluctuate over time, uncovering trends, seasonality and different factors that influence these patterns. Therefore, we can gain valuable insights into the SFO's busiest periods, the impact of external events, and how it integrates itself into the ever-changing flow of travel.

# [Geographical Distribution of Passenger Traffic](/posts/passengerStudy.md)

We'll explore the geographical origins and destinations of passengers traveling through the airport, considering how these patterns correlate with historical events or seasonal variations. Are there spikes in passenger traffic from certain regions during specific seasons or historical events?

# [Airline Performance Comparison](/posts/airlineStudy.md)

 We'll compare the performance of different airlines operating at the airport and relate their performance to significant historical events or seasonal patterns. Does airline performance fluctuate during peak travel seasons or major historical events like economic downturns or airline strikes?

# [Terminal and Boarding Area Analysis](/posts/airportTerminal.md)

We'll analyze the functionality and traffic flow of different terminals and boarding areas of the airport. In particular, we'll examine how the density of passengers in different boarding areas changed over the period in exam and whether it was influenced by historical events.

### [11 of September](/posts/11S.md)

We will focus on studying the impact of the September 11th attack on the activities of San Francisco Airport. Our objective is to determine if certain airline companies have experienced a greater impact than others, and if the event affected air traffic, especially to and from certain parts of the world.


### [COVID-19](/posts/covid.md)

We will zoom in the historical Covid-19 pandemic to understand how this success dramatically shifted the passenger numbers month-by-month. Additionally, geographical patterns will be analyzed to understand which countries were more affected by the restrictions.
