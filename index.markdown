Located in the center of Northern California, San Francisco Airport is a busy hub that links passengers from all over the world. However, some of the historical occurrences and seasonal cycles that have influenced its dynamics and operations may be found under its current appearance.

We're doing more than simply examining statistics and graphs in this investigation; we're also making connections between data points and historical events, seasonal variations, and other contextual elements.
