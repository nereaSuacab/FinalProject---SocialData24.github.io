The impact of the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the aviation industry is palpable and profound. As depicted in the graph below, which illustrates the fluctuation in air traffic volume over time, there is a noticeable and abrupt decline in flight activity immediately following the events of September 11, 2001. This sharp downturn reflects the unprecedented grounding of all civilian aircraft within the United States airspace by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the aftermath of the attacks.

In the days and weeks following 9/11, commercial flights were suspended, airports were temporarily shut down, and stringent security measures were implemented across the globe. This unprecedented disruption to air travel had far-reaching consequences for airlines, airports, and related industries, resulting in significant financial losses and operational challenges.
