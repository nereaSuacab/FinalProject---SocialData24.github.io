This section aims to spotlight the events of September 11th, 2001, and explore the specific consequences it brought to San Francisco Airport.

On September 11th, 2001, a series of coordinated terrorist attacks occurred in the United States, resulting in the destruction of the World Trade Center in New York City, significant damage to the Pentagon near Washington, D.C., and the loss of thousands of lives. These tragic events led to immediate changes in aviation security protocols and widespread disruptions to air travel across the country, including at San Francisco Airport. Flights were grounded, security measures were intensified, and passenger confidence in air travel was significantly shaken. As a result, there was a notable decrease in air traffic activity at San Francisco Airport and airports nationwide in the days and weeks following the attacks.
