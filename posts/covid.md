## COVID-19

In late 2019, a new coronavirus, COVID-19, surfaced in Wuhan, China, rapidly evolving into a global pandemic. The rapid spread of the virus triggered unprecedented global reactions, leading to implementation of lockdowns, travel bans, and social distancing mandates. As a consequence, the aviation industry faced challenges since travel restrictions and plummeting demand led to a sharp decline in flights. Therefore, SFO felt the impact as passenger volumes dwindled, airlines canceled routes and stringtent health protocols were implemented. In this section, these consequences are studied through different visualizations.

# Temporal analysis

As it could have been seen in the [Trends Over Time](/temporalEvolution.md), the number of passengers in SFO had a sharp decreased in 2020 due to COVID. This fact affected the three different types of passengers. To better understand this fact, a stacked bar plots of all the month in the Covid-19 year and the previous and following year were generated to compare these values.

The distribution of the passengers in 2019 is the typical one that follows the seasonal patterns. This means that in the summer months, the amount of travelers increases because of the holiday and the good weather. As it was explained at the beginning, Covid-19 appeared at the end of 2019, however, until March of 2020 it din't become real. At that moment, there is a noticeable fall in the number of people traveling but it is not until April when the lowest peak appeared. This fact could have been caused because in March, some people were still traveling to go back to their homes because of the different added restrictions.
